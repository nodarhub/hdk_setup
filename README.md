## Installation

### Jetson Devices

```bash
./install.sh -d jetson
```

### OnLogic Devices

```bash
./install.sh -d onlogic
```

### With Custom Camera Interfaces

```bash
./install.sh -d onlogic -cam_if1 ethLAN2 -cam_if2 ethLAN3
```

### With External Time Sync (OnLogic only)

To synchronize time from an external PTP grandmaster via ethLAN4:

```bash
./install.sh -d onlogic -cam_if1 ethLAN2 -cam_if2 ethLAN3 -external-time-sync true
```

This reconfigures ethLAN4 from a camera interface to a PTP sync interface (default IP: `192.168.30.25/24`), installs the PTP slave service, and installs PHC2SYS to sync the system clock.

### With External Time Sync and Custom IP

```bash
./install.sh -d onlogic -cam_if1 ethLAN2 -cam_if2 ethLAN3 -external-time-sync true -sync-ip 10.0.0.50/24
```

### With Hammerhead Autostart

To automatically start Hammerhead on boot:

```bash
./install.sh -d jetson -autostart true
./install.sh -d onlogic -autostart true
```

The `-autostart` flag is `false` by default.

### All Flags

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `-d` | Yes | — | Device type: `jetson` or `onlogic` |
| `-cam_if1` | No | `ethLAN2` | First camera interface (OnLogic) |
| `-cam_if2` | No | `ethLAN3` | Second camera interface (OnLogic) |
| `-autostart` | No | `false` | Enable Hammerhead autostart service |
| `-external-time-sync` | No | `false` | Enable external PTP time sync (OnLogic only) |
| `-sync-ip` | No | `192.168.30.25/24` | IP/CIDR for ethLAN4 when external time sync is enabled |

## Uninstallation

### Jetson Devices

```bash
./uninstall.sh -d jetson
```

### OnLogic Devices

```bash
./uninstall.sh -d onlogic
```

The uninstall script always attempts to clean up PTP slave and PHC2SYS services (safe no-ops if never installed) and re-enables `systemd-timesyncd`.

## Modules

### Background Services (Both platforms)

Disables unnecessary system services to ensure a stable, predictable real-time environment:

- **Update services** - apt-daily, unattended-upgrades, update-notifier, packagekit
- **Indexing services** - Tracker file indexing and metadata extraction
- **Diagnostic services** - ubuntu-report, apport crash reporting, MOTD news
- **Other** - Bluetooth, speech-dispatcher, firmware update checks

Also removes cached update notifications and suppresses future release upgrade prompts. This step is not reverted during uninstall, as these services are generally undesirable on real-time target devices.

### MTU

Configures jumbo frames (MTU 9000) for high-performance data transfer.

- **Jetson**: Creates a NetworkManager dispatcher script to automatically apply settings when interfaces come up
- **OnLogic**: MTU is configured via netplan in the Network module

### Network (OnLogic only)

Configures multi-interface network setup:

**Default (without `-external-time-sync`):**

| Interface | Configuration | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| ethLAN0 | DHCP | Management interface |
| ethLAN1 | Static (10.10.1.10/24) | Gateway interface |
| ethLAN2, 3, 4, 5 | Static (10.10.x.1), MTU 9000 | Camera interfaces |

**With `-external-time-sync true`:**

| Interface | Configuration | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| ethLAN0 | DHCP | Management interface |
| ethLAN1 | Static (10.10.1.10/24) | Gateway interface |
| ethLAN2, 3, 5 | Static (10.10.x.1), MTU 9000 | Camera interfaces |
| ethLAN4 | Static (192.168.30.25/24 or custom) | External PTP time sync |

When external time sync is enabled, ethLAN4's MTU 9000 and DHCP subnet are removed, and the interface is reconfigured for PTP synchronization.

Also configures ISC DHCP server with subnets for camera interfaces.

### PTP Master (Both platforms)

Installs and configures Linux PTP (ptp4l) for precision time synchronization:

- Operates as PTP master clock for connected cameras
- Uses E2E (End-to-End) delay mechanism
- Creates `linuxptp.service` for automatic startup and restart on failure

### PTP Slave (OnLogic only, opt-in)

Configures the device as a PTP slave to synchronize time from an external PTP grandmaster. Only installed when `-external-time-sync true` is passed.

- Operates as PTP slave clock on ethLAN4 using **Layer 2 PTP** (Ethernet frames, not IP)
- The IP address on ethLAN4 is not required for PTP synchronization since Layer 2 is used. If `-sync-ip` is specified, it is recommended to be on the same subnet as the PTP grandmaster for debugging and management purposes (e.g., ping, SSH)
- Syncs to external PTP master (e.g., network grandmaster clock)
- Creates `linuxptp-slave.service` for automatic startup

> **WARNING:** When `-external-time-sync true` is enabled, `systemd-timesyncd` (NTP) is disabled to prevent conflicts with PHC2SYS. This means the system clock is **entirely dependent on the external PTP master**. If the PTP master is unavailable, the system clock will not be synchronized and **may drift or reset to 1970**. **Always ensure a PTP grandmaster is reachable on ethLAN4 before enabling this option.**

### PHC2SYS (OnLogic only, opt-in)

Synchronizes the system clock from the PTP hardware clock. Only installed when `-external-time-sync true` is passed.

- Transfers time from the PTP hardware clock (PHC) to CLOCK_REALTIME
- Runs after PTP slave has synchronized with the external master
- Creates `phc2sys.service` for automatic startup
- `systemd-timesyncd` is disabled during install to give PHC2SYS sole control of the system clock (re-enabled on uninstall)

### Clock (Both platforms)

Maximizes CPU/GPU clocks for optimal real-time performance:

- Sets maximum power profile (`nvpmodel -m 0`)
- Runs `jetson_clocks` for maximum CPU, GPU, and EMC (memory) frequencies
- Maximizes VIC (Video Image Compositor) frequency if available
- Automatically restores default clocks on shutdown

### Hammerhead Autostart (Optional)

Creates a systemd service to automatically start Hammerhead on boot:

- Runs as the user who installs the service (to access user config files)
- Starts after network, DHCP, and PTP services are ready
- When external time sync is enabled, also waits for PTP slave and PHC2SYS services
- Automatically restarts on failure
- Updates journald log level for debug output visibility

**Managing the Hammerhead service (when installed with `-autostart true`):**

```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status hammerhead

# Start / stop / restart
sudo systemctl start hammerhead
sudo systemctl stop hammerhead
sudo systemctl restart hammerhead

# Follow logs in real time
sudo journalctl -u hammerhead -f
```

## Requirements
